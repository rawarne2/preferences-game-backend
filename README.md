# Preferences Game Backend

Backed service for Preferences game that uses TypeScript, Express, and Socket.io.

## Keep-Alive Functionality

This service includes built-in keep-alive functionality to prevent it from sleeping on Render.

### How it works

1. **Health Check Endpoint**: Available at `/health` - returns server status and metrics
2. **Auto Keep-Alive**: In production, the service automatically pings itself every 10 minutes
3. **Render Integration**: Automatically uses Render's `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` environment variable

### Render Deployment

The service automatically detects when deployed to Render by using the `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` environment variable that Render provides automatically. No additional configuration is needed.

### Manual Keep-Alive Options

If you need additional monitoring or want to use external services:

1. **External Service**: Use services like UptimeRobot, Pingdom, or cron-job.org to ping your `/health` endpoint every 10-15 minutes

2. **Cron Job**: Set up a cron job to ping your service:

```bash
# Add to crontab (runs every 10 minutes)
*/10 * * * * curl -s https://preferences-game-backend.onrender.com/health > /dev/null
```

### Monitoring

The service logs keep-alive pings to help with debugging:

```
[2023-12-07T10:00:00.000Z] Keep-alive ping successful
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Basic API information
- `GET /health` - Health check and server metrics
- WebSocket connection for real-time game functionality

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## **Game Flow & Scoring**

1. **Room Creation**: Host creates room and gets a unique room code
2. **Player Joining**: Players join using room code, first player becomes host
3. **Game Start**: Host starts game with specified rounds and cards
4. **Turn Progression**: Game progresses through players as target players
5. **Rankings Submission**: Target player submits their ranking, others submit predictions
6. **Scoring**: Players get points based on how close their predictions match the target's ranking (max 20 points per round, -1 for each position difference)
7. **Next Turn**: Game moves to next player or next round

## **Connection Management**

- Players are marked as `isConnected: false` when they disconnect but remain in the game
- Players can rejoin and will be marked as `isConnected: true`
- Host is reassigned automatically if current host disconnects
- Empty rooms (no connected players) are automatically cleaned up
- Players have 2 minutes of inactivity before being disconnected

---

## **Notes**

- All game state is stored in memory (no persistence)
- Host privileges include starting games and managing turns
- Scoring is calculated server-side to prevent cheating
- Room codes are generated to be unique across all active rooms
